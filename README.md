### Hi there! I'm Helee ðŸ‘‹

I focus on understanding the 'why' behind problems to engineer solutions that are both effective and impactful. With 3 years of experience building software and a Master's in Computer Engineering from Stony Brook University, Iâ€™m continually refining my skills to deliver clean, well-tested code. I'm passionate about using technology to tackle real-world problems and am always on the lookout for like-minded individuals to collaborate with.
