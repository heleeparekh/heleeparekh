### Hi there! I'm Helee ðŸ‘‹

I focus on understanding the 'why' behind problems to engineer solutions that are both effective and impactful.
I have about 3 years of experience building software and right now, I'm pursuing my Master's at Stony Brook University, which is helping me get even better at what I do.
In my work, I pay a lot of attention to developing software that is implemented correctly, while ensuring the code is clean and well-tested.
I believe in the power of technology to transform ideas into reality, and I'm always on the lookout for like-minded individuals to collaborate with.
